# Binary-Heap

Project 2 for my class “CS241 - Data Structures and Algorithms II” where I had to implement a Binary Heap in two different ways. One way is to heapify the array with every insertion of a new number and the other is to heapify the array after populating the array. The end of the program then shows the number of swaps to compare which method is more efficient.
